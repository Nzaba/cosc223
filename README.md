# COSC 223 : Caching Theory

Compile and run the ListReader.java code (run `javac ListReader.java` then java ListReader) before running the code in `CachePolicies.py`. This will generate the sequence of requests needed from request generator and save them in a text file to be used later on. After that open `CachePolicies.py` using a text editor of your choice. This will call on the main function which runs all the simulations. The following are the inputs, outputs of the implemented functions;

## Installation
